Intensive immunosuppression in intractable rheumatoid arthritis.

JOURNAL ARTICLE.

Twelve patients with intractable rheumatoid arthritis were treated with antilymphocyte globulin (ALG), prednisolone and a cytotoxic agent, usually azathioprine, and were followed for 1 year. There was a significant (p less than 0.05) improvement in the mean score for early-morning stiffness, grip strength and the severity of nodules and vasculitis at 6 weeks and 3 months when compared to the initial visit. However, in most patients, this benefit was not sustained despite continued cytotoxic and steroid therapy. A rise in the haemoglobin and fall in ESR was maintained throughout the study period.
