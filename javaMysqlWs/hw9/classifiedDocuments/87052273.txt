Transection of varicose vessels in the nasal mucosa of patients with recurrent epistaxis. A 2-year follow-up.

JOURNAL ARTICLE.

Twenty-two patients with recurrent nose bleeds and varicose vessels on the nasal septum were subjected to transection of the vessels and followed-up for 2 years. One month after the operation, it was not possible to identify the original vessels. In other locations new varicose vessels began to appear after 1 month, and at the end of the follow-up period were observed on 9 out of 10 operated sides. The transection resulted in an immediate decrease in the frequency of nose bleeds and at the end of the control period 12 (55%) of the patients had had less than 4 bleeds during the previous year in spite of the observed rapid formation of new vessels. Mucosal atrophy with symptoms of increased nasal crusting occurred in 3 patients. Transection of varicose vessels in patients with nose bleeds leads to a decrease in the number of bleeds.
