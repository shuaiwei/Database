A 5-year follow-up of undiagnosed haematuria.

JOURNAL ARTICLE.

Eighty-four patients with haematuria were seen during 1976 and 1977. This symptom was investigated but no definite cause could be found. Five or more years later they were followed up. Although some patients had experienced further urological symptoms, none was found to have developed a malignancy in the genito-urinary tract. Possible causes of their bleeding are discussed.
