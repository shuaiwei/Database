Regression of Labrador keratopathy following cataract extraction.

JOURNAL ARTICLE.

Labrador keratopathy (LK) is an acquired corneal degeneration thought to be caused by chronic exposure to solar irradiation. Reports so far suggest that it is a progressive or at least a stationary condition. There are no detailed reports on recommended therapy. A prospective clinical study was conducted to show regression of LK following extracapsular cataract extraction. Seventeen black patients (26 eyes) with LK and mature cataracts underwent extracapsular cataract extraction. The severity of the LK was recorded photographically pre- and postoperatively. The follow-up ranged from 6 to fifteen months. Twenty-four eyes (92%) showed regression of the LK. The reduction in exposure to ultraviolet light as a result of aphakic photophobia could be one of the factors which have led to the regression of the LK.
