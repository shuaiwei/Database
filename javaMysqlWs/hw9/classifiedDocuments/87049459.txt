Ventilation, ventilatory carbon dioxide and hormonal response during halothane anaesthesia and surgery in children after midazolam premedication.

JOURNAL ARTICLE.

In 14 intubated, spontaneously breathing children with body weight (bw) ranging from 8.3 to 25.6 kg, the influence of midazolam 0.1 mg kg-1 i.m. (group M0.1, n = 7) and 0.2 mg kg-1 i.m. (group M0.2, n = 7) as premedication, on sedation, ventilation, ventilatory response to carbon dioxide and hormonal stress response was studied in connection with minor surgical procedures during halothane anaesthesia. The concentrations of catecholamines, ACTH and cortisol were measured immediately after induction, during undisturbed anaesthesia, during surgery and 15 min after the end of the surgical procedure. Sedation was better and plasma catecholamine concentrations during undisturbed anaesthesia were less in children receiving the larger dose of midazolam. During surgery and in recovery there were no differences in hormone concentrations. In recovery, the concentrations of all hormones were significantly greater compared with during undisturbed anaesthesia. During surgery, VE and respiratory rate were somewhat lower in group M0.2 while E' CO2 was similar. A dose dependent depression of the response to carbon dioxide was found. However, clinically, the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide after surgery was considered to be adequate in both groups.
