Familial breast cancer in males. A case report and review of the literature.

JOURNAL ARTICLE.

The occurrence of breast cancer in two related males, an uncle and nephew is reported. A review of previously reported cases of male breast cancer occurring in families and the association with other cancers in other family members is included. In previous reports on breast cancer in males, familial or hereditary factors have not generally been recognized as a major contributing factor. Of ten families reported (including our own) where there is sufficient information given, six families (60%) had females with breast cancer. It appears there are some families in which males as well as females have an increased risk of developing breast cancer.
