Nongerminomatous malignant germ cell tumors in children. A review of 89 cases from the Pediatric Oncology Group, 1971-1984.

JOURNAL ARTICLE.

Clinical and morphologic features of 89 cases of childhood yolk sac tumor (YS) and embryonal carcinoma (EC) (29 associated with teratomas) submitted to the Rare Tumor Registry of the Southwest Oncology Group (1971-1979) or the Pediatric Oncology Group (1980-1984) between 1971 and 1984 were reviewed and submitted to statistical analysis. This review showed an improved survival for each 5-year period regardless of tumor site, no statistically significant difference between  pure  tumors and those mixed with other teratomatous components, no statistically significant difference between YS and EC in children, a better than reported prognosis for sacrococcygeal tumors occurring after the neonatal period, a particularly poor prognosis for neonatal  benign  sacrococcygeal teratomas resected without coccygectomy when they recur as YS, excellent survival for all testicular tumors regardless of age or the presence of EC, and the occurrence of mediastinal tumors in females.
