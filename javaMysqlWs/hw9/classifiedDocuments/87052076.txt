Dietary guidelines for healthy American adults. A statement for physicians and health professionals by the Nutrition Committee, American Heart Association.

JOURNAL ARTICLE.

This statement for physicians replaces the American Heart Association's Diet and Coronary Heart Disease, published in 1978. The current guidelines propose an optimal preventive diet for coronary heart disease. Emphasis is placed on the reduction of both saturated fat and total fat. Complex carbohydrates are recommended as the major replacement for calories from fat. Polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats partially replace calories from other fat sources. Cholesterol and sodium guidelines are expressed relative to caloric intake, with an upper limit on each. The use of alcohol as a possible means of preventing cardiovascular disease is not advised. Maintenance of ideal body weight by calorie control and an adequate level of activity is emphasized.
