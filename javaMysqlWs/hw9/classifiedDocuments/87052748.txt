Irritation, sensitization, photoirritation and photosensitization assays with a glyphosate herbicide.

JOURNAL ARTICLE.

Glyphosate, a widely utilized herbicide, was evaluated for acute irritation, cumulative irritation, photoirritation and allergic and photoallergic contact potential in 346 volunteers. The herbicide was less irritant than a standard liquid dishwashing detergent and a general all purpose cleaner. There was no evidence for the induction of photoirritation, allergic or photoallergic contact dermatitis. 10% glyphosate in water is proposed as a diagnostic patch test concentration.
