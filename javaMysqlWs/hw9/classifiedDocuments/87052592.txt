Psychosis and pregnancy.

JOURNAL ARTICLE.

Close, continuous collaboration among the obstetrician, the psychiatrist, and nurses in both disciplines is required to improve the mental health of a patient whose psychosis is associated with pregnancy. These most complex cases require not  either/or  management but the combined attention of specialists in both disciplines.
