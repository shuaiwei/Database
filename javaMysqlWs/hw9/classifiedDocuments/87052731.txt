Discomfort from rubber gloves indicating contact urticaria.

JOURNAL ARTICLE.

Rubber glove intolerance is a common dermatological problem and hypersensitivity of both delayed and immediate types occur. In order to study immediate skin reactions induced by rubber gloves, 15 patients with discomfort and itch produced by rubber gloves were examined. The patients were provoked by wearing rubber gloves, scratch tested with gloves, rubber chemicals and powders. RAST-tests were performed using an extract from the rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis). In 6/15 patients, contact urticaria was confirmed, in 3 of whom IgE antibodies to latex were demonstrated.
