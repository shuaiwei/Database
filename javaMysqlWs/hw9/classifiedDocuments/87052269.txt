Video time-lapse microscopy of human laryngeal carcinomas in vitro.

JOURNAL ARTICLE.

Twelve human laryngeal carcinomas and 14 normal vocal cord epithelia were studied in vitro by the method of tissue culture incorporating video time-lapse microscopy. Different events were photographed by taking 'stills' from the television monitor during play-back. Outgrowths from both tumour and normal explants formed only as monolayers. Mitoses were mainly found to be localized approximately mid-way between explant and the edge of the outgrowth. Some cells were seen to become suddenly active producing oscillating blebs and sometimes they detached themselves from the monolayer culture and changed appearance. This was more prevalent in the tumour cultures. In both tumour and normal cell cultures lymphocytes were observed and their normal chemokinetic movement was changed into a rapid chemotactic attraction by the presence of a mitotic epithelial cell. These lymphocytes appear to represent T-suppressor cells. The present study has shown that primary tissue culture can be a valuable tool in the study of laryngeal carcinoma. The interaction between mitotic tumour cells and lymphocytes may represent a transformation of T-lymphocytes into LAK cells.
