The use of games in occupational therapy of hand burns.

JOURNAL ARTICLE.

The need for active range of motion in hand burns is obvious and through adapted games the patient's interest is aroused and provides an incentive for active participation in his/her therapeutic programme. All the games are for individual players, on different intellectual levels, and provide different active ranges of motion: for fingers, wrist, elbow and shoulder. Most of the games were made by a former patient, now retired, copied from games in the collection of the occupational therapist, and some of the games are of Israeli idea and manufacture. All the games can be gas autoclaved and therefore be used from patient to patient. The games also provide a much needed outlet for intellectual stimuli and distraction from the burns unit and all it signifies.
