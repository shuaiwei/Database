A new method for intraoral patch testing.

JOURNAL ARTICLE.

Intraoral patch testing was performed in 3 subjects, 2 of whom were contact sensitive to nickel. Maxillary acrylic plates carrying test pieces containing 66% nickel were applied for 48 h, and readings were performed 24 h after removal. Few if any clinical signs were detected, but biopsies from the mucosal contact sites showed lichenoid reactions. Biopsies from control sites showed no or slight non-specific inflammatory reactions.
