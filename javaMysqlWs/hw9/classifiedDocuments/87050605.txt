Comparison of primary orchiectomy with oestrogen therapy in advanced prostatic cancer. A 2-year follow-up report of a national, prospective prostatic cancer study.

JOURNAL ARTICLE.

Two hundred and seventy-seven patients with advanced prostatic cancer were treated by either orchiectomy or oestrogen. During the 2-year follow-up period, the response to treatment was considered more favourable in the oestrogen group, and this response was particularly emphasised in patients with poorly differentiated tumour and metastases at the time of diagnosis. Further evaluations included the cardiovascular side effects of oestrogen therapy.
