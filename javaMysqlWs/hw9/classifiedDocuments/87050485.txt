Peptic ulcer in rheumatoid arthritis--intrinsic or related to drug therapy?

JOURNAL ARTICLE.

The reported incidence of peptic ulcer disease (PUD) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is higher than that of the general population. Unusual susceptibility to PUD in RA, independent of therapy, has been suggested. To compare RA patients with others who had similar drug exposure but no known predisposition to PUD, 120 patients hospitalized for treatment of severe arthritis (65 with RA, 55 with osteoarthritis) were assessed by questionnaire for PUD history, drug history and other relevant variables. The relationship of PUD to sex distribution, smoking, alcohol consumption and anti-inflammatory therapy followed expected patterns. We found high but similar PUD rates in RA and osteoarthritis (OA) patients (RA 15%, OA 18%). This suggests that a common factor (probably drugs) is responsible. We feel that the documented high incidence of PUD in RA is most probably related to drug therapy. Available methods cannot determine if PUD ever occurs as a primary manifestation of RA.
