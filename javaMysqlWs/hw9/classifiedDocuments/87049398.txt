Maintenance of compliance in a small diameter arterial prosthesis.

JOURNAL ARTICLE.

This study demonstrates that 20 to 30 microns porous, Replamineform silicone rubber prostheses remain isocompliant with adjacent arterial segments up to 8 months following implantation. This finding contrasts with the results of currently available prostheses, including autologous vein, which rapidly become minimally compliant. We conclude that this vascular construction is stable over the long-term following implantation and may improve the success of small internal diameter arterial reconstruction by eliminating failures caused by intimal hyperplasia.
