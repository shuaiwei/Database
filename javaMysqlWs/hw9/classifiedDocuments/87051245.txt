Long-term survival and morbidity in patients with metastatic malignant germ cell tumors treated with cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy.

JOURNAL ARTICLE.

Forty-three of 79 patients treated for clinically metastatic germ cell cancer survived for a median of 66 months (range, 52-83). In patients without previous chemotherapy the 5-year survival rate was 69%, whereas only 32% of patients with prior chemotherapy survived for 5 years. Limited disease, complete clinical response, histopathologically proven postchemotherapy tumor necrosis or complete resectability of a posttreatment mature teratoma indicated a favorable prognosis in patients without prior chemotherapy. Only 20% to 30% of the patients with less than a clinical complete response or with posttreatment residual malignant tumor can be salvaged by second line therapy. Posttreatment mature teratoma should be resected completely whenever possible, as this condition may lead to reactivation of the malignancy even after several years. Raynaud-like phenomena and/or gastrointestinal problems are the main long-term sequel (10%-15%) after modern multimodality treatment of advanced germ cell cancer (fertility-related problems are not considered here). In the majority of surviving patients, the lifestyle seems unaffected by the previous intensive treatment, evaluated about 5 years after discontinuation of all therapy.
