Evaluation of E and EAC rosette-forming cells in patients with thermal injuries.

JOURNAL ARTICLE.

Thermal injuries lead to changes in both the cell-mediated and humoral responses of the patient. This study was undertaken to assess these responses in the post-burn period and also to see if bacterial infection altered these responses. It has been concluded that alterations in the cell-mediated and humoral immune responses following thermal injuries are altered by infection and consequently are also important in the healing process.
