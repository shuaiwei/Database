Effect of the calcium channel blocker nitrendipine on left ventricular mass in patients with hypertension.

JOURNAL ARTICLE.

Reductions in left ventricular (LV) mass have been reported after antihypertensive therapy with certain sympatholytic agents and converting enzyme inhibitors, but little or no improvement has been noted after vasodilator therapy. In this study we evaluated the effect of the calcium channel blocker nitrendipine on echocardiographic LV mass. During a 12-month period, nitrendipine was used as monotherapy in 30 patients and in combination with propranolol or a diuretic in an additional 28 patients. Nitrendipine monotherapy lowered supine blood pressure from 148/97 to 136/83 mm Hg, but LV mass did not change significantly. Supine blood pressure decreased from 155/103 to 134/86 mm Hg in patients receiving combination therapy but, again, changes in LV mass were not significant. These data suggest that nitrendipine is effective in lowering blood pressure, but this is not associated with a significant decrease in LV mass in patients with mild hypertension.
