Ipsilateral femoral neck and shaft fractures. Report of two cases using an alternate technique.

JOURNAL ARTICLE.

A technique for ipsilateral femoral neck and shaft fracture using the sliding compression hip screw with plate combined with trochanteric antegrade Ender nailing of the femur was applied in two cases. Ender nails can be passed without difficulty past a compression hip screw and the bicortical plating screws. The hip and femur can be fixed internally through a single approach in a single position. Sliding compression hip screw devices can provide excellent preliminary stable femoral neck fixation. Blood supply to the femoral head is not disturbed while the femoral intramedullary fixation is performed. Antegrade Ender nailing avoids the common knee complications associated with other retrograde techniques. Decreased operative time, less blood loss, less technical difficulty, and early mobilization are important factors in the multiple-injured patient. Femoral intramedullary fixation may require open reduction, circlerage to ensure stability, and maintenance of alignment in case of significant comminution to allow early crutch ambulation. This mode of fixation may be advantageous for selected cases.
