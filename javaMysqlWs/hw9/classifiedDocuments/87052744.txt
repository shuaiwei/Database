Occupational skin disease in hospital cleaning and kitchen workers.

JOURNAL ARTICLE.

Skin disorders were reported in 33% of catering staff and 35% of women cleaners who returned a questionnaire, and were employed in a large hospital. Hand dermatitis occurred in 15% of the caterers and 12% of the cleaners. In the majority, the dermatitis was irritant in origin and related to their wet work occupations. Cleaners had a high prevalence of jewellery dermatitis. Limited patch testing revealed a majority positive to nickel, but a third were negative, indicating that jewellery reactions often but not invariably predict nickel sensitivity. Few subjects were atopic, but some psoriatic patients with hand problems were encountered. Most workers were able to carry on in their occupations despite having hand dermatitis.
