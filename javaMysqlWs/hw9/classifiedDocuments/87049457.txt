Prospective study of liver function in children following multiple halothane anaesthetics at short intervals.

JOURNAL ARTICLE.

In the 4 years January 1981 to December 1984, 186 children received 1362 halothane anaesthetics. Twenty-five patients were anaesthetized with halothane at least 10 times in a year. No patient developed postoperative jaundice. Sixty-nine children were exposed to two halothane anaesthetics within 28 days on 149 occasions and serial estimations of serum liver enzyme concentrations were obtained. Minor increases in the concentrations of serum AST and ALT were recorded in 10.6% and 4.7% of patient entries, respectively. Postoperative GGT and SAP concentrations were increased in 2.7% of patient entries. Patients in whom enzyme values were increased before the first anaesthetic were no more likely than other subjects to develop further changes.
