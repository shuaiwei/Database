Dermatitis from quinazoline oxide.

JOURNAL ARTICLE.

Dermatitis from 2-chloromethyl-4-phenyl-6-chloroquinazoline-3-oxide, an intermediate product in the preparation of chlorodiazepoxide, is described in 29 workers at a pharmaceutical plant. All were patch test positive to quinazoline oxide (1%) and six to 0.05%. In most patients, the face was earlier and more severely involved than the hands. Some were sensitized even if they did not have much contact with it, doing such work as washing the clothing of other workers, or working at a distance of 100 m from the production line building.
