Permeation of nickel salts through human skin in vitro.

JOURNAL ARTICLE.

The impact of occlusion and the role of the counter ion on the permeation of nickel ions through skin have been examined using excised human skin. A highly sensitive electrochemical method was used to quantify the amount of nickel permeating the skin. The investigations show that nickel ions are capable of permeating the skin barrier when applied under occlusion. The process is slow, having a lag time of approximately 50 h. The permeation rate, and thus the physical amount being bioavailable, is considerably increased when aqueous nickel chloride is used in comparison with aqueous nickel sulphate. With respect to nickel permeation of the skin, we conclude that the choice of salt is an important consideration in patch testing.
