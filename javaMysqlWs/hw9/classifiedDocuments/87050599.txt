Endoscopic correction of vesicoureteric reflux secondary to neuropathic bladder.

JOURNAL ARTICLE.

Eleven patients with vesicoureteric reflux secondary to neuropathic bladder were treated by endoscopic injection of pyrolised polytetrafluoroethylene (Polytef) paste. Thirteen of the 15 ureters treated showed disappearance of reflux after one injection. The amount of Polytef paste injected varied from 0.2 to 0.9 ml (mean 0.45 ml). There were no complications, except in one ureter where distension of the collecting system was slightly increased compared with the pre-operative urogram.
