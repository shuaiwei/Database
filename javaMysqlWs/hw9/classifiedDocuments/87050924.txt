Epidemiology of severe burn injuries.

JOURNAL ARTICLE.

The epidemiology of severe burns is analysed. From 1 September 1982 to 31 August 1983 75 patients, 27 females and 48 males were admitted to the Burns Unit in Copenhagen. The majority of burns were domestic and fire was the predominant cause. The most vulnerable areas were the arms and the legs, and small children still have the highest incidence of thermal injury. As predisposing factors were of significance in several accidents, the importance of further prevention is stressed.
