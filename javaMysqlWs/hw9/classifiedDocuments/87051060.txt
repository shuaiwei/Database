The potential damaging effects of light on the eye (Part I).

JOURNAL ARTICLE.

The electromagnetic spectrum consists of radiant energy that is classified according to specific wavelengths. Man is constantly exposed to a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, particularly to radiation in the ultraviolet, visible and infrared regions. The tissues of the eye and skin are particularly sensitive to the non-ionizing wavelengths of radiant energy. Although both tissues possess endogenous protective mechanisms to minimize the effects of such exposure, problems still occur due to the absorption of radiation. The cornea, lens and retina have been shown to be susceptible to damage from light in the ultraviolet, visible and infrared range. Part I of this two-part article examines the structures of the eye that are most susceptible to light damage; part II, which will be published in the next issue of the Journal, focuses on eye protection.
