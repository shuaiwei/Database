Inhibitors of urinary stone formation in 40 recurrent stone formers.

JOURNAL ARTICLE.

The excretion of four inhibitors of urinary stone formation (zinc, magnesium, citrates and glycosaminoglycans (GAG) was studied in 20 normal controls and 40 recurrent calcium stone formers who were placed on a fixed diet restricted in calcium, oxalates and purines. We were unable to show any abnormality in the excretion of Zn, Mg or GAG. In 11 patients, a low level of urinary citrate was a significant feature that was associated in most cases with a urinary pH value above 6. Citrate concentration (per litre) and output (per 24 h) were found to be lower than in the controls in 19 and 33% respectively of the determinations. The overall ratio of average urinary citrate concentration in patients and controls was 0.56, a figure in agreement with previous data.
