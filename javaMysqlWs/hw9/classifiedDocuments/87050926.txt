Calcinosis cutis--a rare late complication of burns.

JOURNAL ARTICLE.

Pillars of calcification are rarely found in the skin. An interesting case is described where rows of new bone developed in the skin which had been grafted 31 years previously to cover partial skin thickness burns of the shin. The problems of heterotropic ossification are discussed.
