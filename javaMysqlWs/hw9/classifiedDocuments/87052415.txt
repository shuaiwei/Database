Osteoid osteoma in a cervical pedicle. Resection via transpillar approach.

JOURNAL ARTICLE.

Lesions in the pedicles of the cervical spine are both a diagnostic and technical challenge. An osteoid osteoma of the pedicle of the fourth cervical vertebra occurred in a 17-year-old girl. Resection of the tumor adjacent to the dura medially and the vertebral artery anterolaterally was accomplished via a transpillar approach. The transosseus approach preserved the facet joints and posterior elements and obviated the need for an interbody fusion.
