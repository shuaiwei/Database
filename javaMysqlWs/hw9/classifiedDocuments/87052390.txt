Reversible membranous glomerulonephritis associated with ketoprofen.

JOURNAL ARTICLE.

An 87-year-old woman presented with the nephrotic syndrome 12 months after administration of ketoprofen, 100 mg daily for osteoarthritis. Clinical course and laboratory data were consistent with drug-induced nephropathy. Kidney biopsy showed membranous glomerulonephritis. Evolution was favorable with resolution of proteinuria after drug withdrawal and steroid administration. A review of the literature on nephrotic syndrome associated with NSAID reveals membranous glomerulonephritis to be an unusual complication.
