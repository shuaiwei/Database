Should the Mobile Intensive Care Unit respond to pediatric emergencies?

JOURNAL ARTICLE.

Between October 1982 and October 1985, the Mobile Intensive Care Unit (MICU) in Jerusalem responded to 625 pediatric emergencies, representing 5% of the total MICU case load. The most common medical problem was seizures, diagnosed in 205 cases (33%). The second most frequent group related to trauma (175 cases; 28%). There were 71 cases (11.4%) of cardiac arrest. Resuscitation was attempted in 37, but there were no long-term survivors. Almost all cardiac arrest patients were found in asystole, and most had antecedent serious medical problems. Compared with the adult population, children were less likely to require or benefit from an advanced level of prehospital care. When resources for advanced care are limited, priority should be given to adult emergencies.
