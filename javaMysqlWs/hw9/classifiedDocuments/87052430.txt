JOURNAL ARTICLE.

Two cases of osteochondritis dissecans of the talar dome treated by closed percutaneous drilling are presented to illustrate a procedure for high-risk patients. The operation is performed with the aid of an image intensifier. The ostoechondral fragment is percutaneously drilled to avoid open operation and osteotomizing the medial malleolus.
