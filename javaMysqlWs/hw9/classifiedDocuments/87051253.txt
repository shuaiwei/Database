Tuberculosis-associated hemophagocytic syndrome. A systemic process.

JOURNAL ARTICLE.

Virus-associated hemophagocytic syndrome has been recently identified as a benign, reactive histiocytic proliferation distinct from Rappaport's malignant hystiocytosis. Other etiologic agents, including different bacteria, have also been identified. Three autopsy cases of hemophagocytic syndrome associated to acute tuberculous sepsis are presented. Benign histiocytic proliferation with striking hemophagocytosis was present in a disseminated, multisystemic pattern in all three cases. A relationship between systemic histiocytic proliferation and an anergic status in these patients is suggested.
