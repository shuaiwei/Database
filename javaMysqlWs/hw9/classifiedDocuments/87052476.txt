The natural history of idiopathic chest pain in children. A follow-up study.

JOURNAL ARTICLE.

Repetitive chest pain of obscure origin is commonly encountered in older children and adolescents. A questionnaire study was conducted to determine the long-term outcome in 31 patients diagnosed as having idiopathic recurrent chest pain after an average 4.1-year follow-up period. Although 45 percent reported having had persistent symptoms, chest pain had disappeared in 81 percent of those followed more than 3 years. Equally reassuring is the fact that in no case did occult disease subsequently appear to account for the initial symptoms. This study supports the current clinical approach of limited diagnostic evaluation and reassurance in the management of these patients.
