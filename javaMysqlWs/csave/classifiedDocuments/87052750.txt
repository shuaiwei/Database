Chloracne from pentachlorophenol-preserved wood.

JOURNAL ARTICLE.

A patient is presented who developed chloracne after exposure to lumber which was pressure-treated with pentachlorophenol (PCP). It was presumed that his disease arose via percutaneous absorption of polychlorinated aromatic compounds (dioxins and furans) which are known to contaminate technical grade PCP. The patient's condition improved after treatment with oral isotretinoin.
