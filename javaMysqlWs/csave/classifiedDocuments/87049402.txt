Bilirubin removal from a jaundiced premature infant by resin hemoperfusion.

JOURNAL ARTICLE.

To summarize the results: Bilirubin removal by hemoperfusion was successfully performed for the first time on a premature infant. The hemoperfusion caused no adverse effects on the clinical state of the infant. The bilirubin removed in 90 min--13 mg--indicates the existence of a large extravascular pool. Hemoperfusion is suggested for bilirubin removal from newborn babies, reducing the need for blood exchange with bank blood.
