Intraarticular methylprednisolone acetate in knee arthrotomy.

JOURNAL ARTICLE.

Ninety-eight arthrotomy patients undergoing meniscectomy were given intraoperative intraarticular methylprednisolone (40 mg) or placebo using double-blind technique and were evaluated clinically at three days, two weeks, four weeks, eight weeks, and twelve weeks after operation. Patients who received methylprednisolone showed small but statistically significant accelerated rehabilitation time with respect to subjectively evaluated pain and range of motion, through two weeks after operation. After two weeks, there was no further advantage over placebo through 12 weeks of rehabilitation.
