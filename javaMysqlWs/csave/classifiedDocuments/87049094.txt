Acute carbon monoxide poisoning during pregnancy.

JOURNAL ARTICLE.

The course of a pregnant patient at term who was acutely exposed to carbon monoxide is described. A review of the fetal-maternal carboxyhemoglobin relationships and the differences in fetal oxyhemoglobin physiology are used to explain the recommendation that pregnant women with carbon monoxide poisoning should receive 100% oxygen therapy for up to five times longer than is otherwise necessary. The role of hyperbaric oxygen therapy is considered.
