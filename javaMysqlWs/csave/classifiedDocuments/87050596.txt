Fistula and sinus formation in xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis. A clinicopathological review and report of four cases.

JOURNAL ARTICLE.

Fistula or deep sinus formation as a complication of xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis (XPN) has not been described previously in the British literature. We present the clinicopathological features of one case of a nephrodiaphragmatic sinus complicating XPN, and three cases of nephrocolic fistula, including the first recorded case of fistula in childhood XPN. The detailed clinical, radiological and pathological features of XPN and its complications are reviewed. Total nephrectomy, together with primary excision of sinuses or fistulae, is the treatment of choice.
