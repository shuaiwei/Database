Inferences from beading of a retinal vein draining a choroidal melanoma.

JOURNAL ARTICLE.

Beading of a retinal vein draining a choroidal melanoma is reported, showing that the endothelial proliferation producing the beading is a response to some blood borne factor(s) traversing the vein and that retinal capillary non-perfusion adjacent to the beaded vein is not a necessary part of the process.
