Use of scarred flaps and secondary flaps for reconstructive surgery of extensive burns.

JOURNAL ARTICLE.

We report the usefulness of scar flaps and secondary flaps in the surgical repair of extensively burned patients. Burn scar contractures repaired with scarred axial pattern flaps, scarred musculocutaneous flaps and scarred fasciocutaneous flaps are described. However, it is our contention that their application should be strictly limited. An example of the use of scarred secondary axial pattern and musculocutaneous flaps for reconstruction of a burned ear is shown.
