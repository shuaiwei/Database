Nonoperative management of isolated grade III collateral ligament injury in high school football players.

JOURNAL ARTICLE.

In a prospective study, 24 high school football players with isolated Grade III injuries of the medial collateral ligament (MCL) of the knee were treated by conservative management. This included an active rehabilitation program, progressing from immobilization and controlled motion in an orthotic rehabilitation knee brace, to muscle strengthening and agility exercise. A stable knee was achieved in 22 cases; the average recovery time was 29 days. The athletes returned to competitive sports at a mean time of 34 days. These results confirm previous reports of successful nonoperative management of isolated Grade III MCL injuries.
