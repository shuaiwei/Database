Sensitization to epichlorohydrin and epoxy system components.

JOURNAL ARTICLE.

In an epoxy resin manufacturing plant, 26 of 228 (11.4%) workers had work-related eruptions; 19 were patch tested. The test series consisted of chemicals used in the manufacturing process, a standard battery and some other sensitizers. The prevalence of sensitization to epichlorohydrin and/or epoxy resins in the whole group was 6.1%. A relatively high prevalence (3.5%) of epichlorohydrin sensitization was found. 10 cases of sensitization to liquid epoxy resin (MW about 385) were observed, in 7 cases combined with allergy to solid epoxy resin (MW 980). Sensitization to Bisphenol A was not seen.
