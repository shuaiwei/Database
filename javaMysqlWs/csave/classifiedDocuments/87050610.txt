Fracture of the penis and long-term results of surgical treatment.

JOURNAL ARTICLE.

Twenty-five patients with fracture of the penis were treated surgically between 1968 and 1984. Long-term follow-up was obtained in 17. In no case were there any early post-operative complications. All patients stated that they were achieving normal, painless erections; two patients developed a slight penile curvature but this did not affect their sexual activities. We strongly recommend early surgical intervention because of these encouraging results. Urethral injury associated with the fracture did not occur in this series.
