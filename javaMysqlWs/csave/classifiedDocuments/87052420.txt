Tibial component fixation in knee arthroplasty.

JOURNAL ARTICLE.

Using roentgen stereophotogrammetric analysis (RSA), the integrity of the bond between the tibial component and the tibia was studied in seven knees, implanted with a cemented Kinematic total knee prosthesis for gonarthrosis. Migration ranging from 0.3 to 1.9 mm over a two-year period occurred in all seven cases. Displacement, induced by external forces, ranging from 0.2 to 1.0 mm was observed in five cases. Measurable migration and inducible displacement may be the rule rather than an exception in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Accordingly, absolute rigid fixation would not be necessary for successful function of a TKA.
