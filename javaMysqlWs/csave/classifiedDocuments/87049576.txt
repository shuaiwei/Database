Posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation--a new forceps to simplify capsular bag fixation.

JOURNAL ARTICLE.

The case for capsular bag fixation of the Sinsky-Kratz type of posterior chamber intraocular implant lens is presented, and the various methods in use to position implant lenses are outlined. The new forceps are described and the rationale for their adoption and use is given in an illustrated, step-by-step fashion. Their additional use in anterior chamber intraocular lens implantation is mentioned. There is a brief summary of the author's experience with this instrument.
