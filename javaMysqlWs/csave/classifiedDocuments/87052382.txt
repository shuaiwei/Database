Triamterene-induced crystalluria and cylinduria: clinical and experimental studies.

JOURNAL ARTICLE.

We examined the occurrence of crystals and casts in the urine of healthy subjects after administration of triamterene and the site of crystal formation in experimental animals. Twenty out of twenty healthy subjects had abundant triamterene crystals and casts in acid urine after receiving a single 100 mg dose. Casts were present in the urine from 2-11 hours after administration of the diuretic. Cast formation occurred in acidic urine and was prevented by alkalinization of the urine with potassium citrate. Animal studies showed that crystallization and cast formation occurred in the medullary and papillary collecting ducts of the rat kidney. These findings provide a possible explanation for the reported nephrotoxicity of triamterene, particularly when given to patients who are receiving non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents.
