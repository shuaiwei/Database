Age and sex incidence of allergic contact dermatitis.

JOURNAL ARTICLE.

A retrospective study of patients patch tested between 1968 and 1970 was undertaken and case records of 200 patients with unequivocal positive patch tests were studied for age and sex distribution. There was an overall female preponderance (61%), with 2 peaks of incidence in the 10-20 and 40-50 year age groups in females, but only 1 peak of incidence in the 40-50 year age group in males. There was a steady decline in all sensitivities after the 6th decade of life in both sexes. Nickel sensitivity was more common in females (92%), whereas dichromate sensitivity predominated in males (64%). Of the 200 patients, only 5(2.5%) were atopics, all of whom were females.
