Clinical tests for carpal tunnel syndrome: an evaluation.

JOURNAL ARTICLE.

Five clinical tests in common use for diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndromes have been shown to have little diagnostic value, either individually or in various combinations. No physical sign is useful in the diagnosis of this condition, which should be suspected on the basis of presenting symptoms and confirmed by electrodiagnosis using standard median nerve conduction tests.
