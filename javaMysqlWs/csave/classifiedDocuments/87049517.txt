Blisters over burn scars in a child.

JOURNAL ARTICLE.

We present the case of an 11-month-old baby with a burn that healed normally over a month, but subsequently developed successive crops of blisters over the scar. There were no changes in his general condition. Clinical, immunological, histological and ultrastructural studies provided a diagnosis of mechanical dermatitis produced by microtrauma. Electron microscopy studies revealed the sub-epidermal nature of the blisters and the presence of underlying fibrin deposits.
