Epidemiology of industrial burns in Brisbane.

JOURNAL ARTICLE.

A retrospective epidemiological study of industrial burns admitted to the Royal Brisbane Hospital was conducted over a period of 7 years. A total of 182 patients were included in this survey--173 males (95 per cent) and 9 females (5 per cent). The proportion of industrial burns has decreased from 31.5 per cent to 18.5 per cent of total admissions to the burns unit over the past 10 years. Fifty per cent of the burns occurred in males less than 30 years old. The average age was 31 years. Two-thirds of the burns covered less than 10 per cent of the body and 84 per cent covered less than 20 per cent. While scalds were the commonest cause of industrial burns in our study (19.4 per cent), flame burns with clothing ignited caused the most extensive burns. Face and hands were the most common sites involved. Burns to these regions were mainly caused by flame and electrical burns. Eye burns comprised 5.5 per cent of the sample and were due to chemicals, gas explosions and electric flash. Twenty-six patients (14 per cent) suffered respiratory injury. Only one patient out of our series of 182 died. Progress has been made in industrial safety in the past few years but carelessness and human error still take their toll.
