Atropine in the treatment of baclofen overdose.

JOURNAL ARTICLE.

A patient suffering baclofen overdose successfully treated with atropine is reported. Three hours after admission for ingestion of at least 300 mg baclofen as a single dose, the patient became comatose and subsequently bradycardic, hypotensive, and hypothermic. A prompt increase in heart rate and blood pressure followed administration of 1 mg of atropine sulfate. Atropine appears to be useful in treating cases of baclofen overdose complicated by bradycardia and hypotension.
