Successful treatment of psoriasis with topical application of active vitamin D3 analogue, 1 alpha,24-dihydroxycholecalciferol.

JOURNAL ARTICLE.

We treated 11 psoriatic patients with topical 1 alpha,24-dihydroxycholecalciferol, a new synthetic analogue of active vitamin D3. In 10 of 15 tests the lesions cleared completely within 1-4 weeks, although some relapses occurred shortly after cessation of treatment. There were no side-effects. We suggest that 1 alpha, 24(OH)2D3 merits further investigation as a potentially useful topical therapy for psoriasis.
